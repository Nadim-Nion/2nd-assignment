# 2nd-assignment (Responsive Website)


I made this site by utilizing HTML5, and CSS3. To make its design adaptable to all gadgets, I have set media query with the goal that this site's format can fit on PC, cell phone, and tablet. It is my second responsive site utilizing media query. I will not be utilizing media query in the future since I will learn CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind to make the site's design receptive to all screen sizes.
